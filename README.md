# PerceiveAI: Smart Object Detection

**PerceiveAI** is a web-based system designed for real-time object detection and distance measurement using the YOLOv8 algorithm. It automates visual data analysis to enhance safety and efficiency in industrial and surveillance environments.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* Core:Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV
* Web: Next.js (Frontend), Flask (Backend) 

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-Time Detection:** Captures and analyzes live video frames for immediate classification.
* **Distance Estimation:** Systematically calculates the distance of objects for precise localization.
* **Video Analysis:** Allows users to upload video files for automated processing via a web interface.

## 📊 Performance
The system leverages **YOLOv8**, which demonstrated superior accuracy during testing, showing a **33.21% improvement** in detection (Nano model) compared to YOLOv5.

## 👥 Context
Developed for **CSE 299 - Junior Design** at North South University.
